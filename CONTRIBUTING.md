## Style Guides

### Git Style Guide

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch, rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ and summarised in the next few points
    * In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
    * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
    * Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
    * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
    * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)

### Go Style Guide

* Run `gofmt` over your code to automatically resolve a lot of style issues. Most editors support this running automatically when saving a code file.
* Run `go lint` and `go vet` on your code too to catch any other issues.
* Follow this guide on some good practice and idioms for Go -  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments
* To check for extra issues, install [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) and run `make lint` or `golangci-lint run`
